# Menu Droppo
## An Animated Menu-Drop React Component

Installation: `npm install menu-droppo -S`.

If you want to experiment locally, you can install `beefy` (`npm install -g beefy`), and then run `npm run sample` to run a live-reloading demo app.

You can edit `sample.js` to change the input parameters, or `index.js` to edit the module itself.

[Read sample usage in sample.js](./sample.js))
